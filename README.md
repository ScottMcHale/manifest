simple objectification of news and opinion using free and opensource tools
.
Sharing my idea and starting points to find help or, even better, already available tools that I'm just not seeing out there.
.

New to GIT, new to CODE, new, new, new, but here's my thinking.

Create users Lens
Use TextBlob to parse reading ( articles, etc ) into:
 - Actions
 - Actors
 - Orgs
 - Observations
 - Reports
 - etc ....

Provide User ability to ratify statements, observations, etc
Provide map of entities - people, orgs, laws, reports, opinions, etc - for user analysis

Ultimately, begin connecting Lenses to create maps of agreement / disagreement

Feel free to ask questions. Answering will help me understand what I'm talking about.
